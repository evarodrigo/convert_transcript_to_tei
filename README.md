# convert_transcript_to_tei
python script to turn transcript into a complete TEI document - work in progress

Two sample files are provided:
* transcript of Syriac translation of Cyprian's letter to Quintus from ms. Paris, Biblioth√®que nationale de France, syr. 62
* output.xml

### Basic idea
Easy instrument for scholars to make a transcription of a manuscript and turn it to a ready xml/TEI document.
The idea is loosely based on https://github.com/PatristicTextArchive/transcription_dsl , see also: dx.doi.org/10.1515/zac-2020-0019 (thanks!).

### Planned
* combination with Collatex (https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/CollateX)

### Current features
* reading in key metadata
* converting line breaks, page breaks, punctuation (needs refinement), rubrics, paragraphs, marginal notes

## Basic Documentation
The idea is to type/transcribe a manuscript in, i.e., Microsoft Word or LibreOffice. This will likely provide better support for special fonts and a more readable layout (individual line spacing etc.). At the moment, the script is designed with a focus on Syriac, specifically regarding punctuation. A more generic approach will be implemented in the future.

For all explanations below, cf. the sample file (Cyprian-to-Quintus_transcript-from-ms-Paris-syr-62.txt), if necessary.

### (1) Metadata
At the beginning of the document, the following metadata must be provided, each in a single line:
* Author, wrapped in `<a></a>`
* Title, wrapped in `<t></t>`
* Siglum, wrapped in `<s></s>` -- In the sample file, the siglum chosen is rather verbose. It's recommended not to use spaces, as the siglum will be used as an xml id.
* Transcriber, wrapped in `<tr></tr>` -- Provide full name of person who transcribed the manuscript, i.e. "Mary S. Black".
* Initials of transcriber, wrapped in `<tri></tri>` -- Provide initials of that person, i.e. "msb". This will also be turned into an xml id.

### (2) Transcription
The transcription follows in a new line right after the metadata. Currently, the following features can be transcribed:
* Rubrics, wrapped in `<r></r>`
* Paging, transcribed as, e.g. `|fol. 34v|` -- For the vertical bar (|), also known as pipe, see https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pipe.htm#pipe. The expression `fol.` must be followed by a space.
* Linebreaks, transcribed simply as a new line. -- This helps in proof reading against the manuscript.
* Marginal notes, wrapped in `<mx></m>`, where `x` is either `t`, `r`, `l`, `b`, or `a`, which stand for top, right, left, bottom or above, respectively. Note that `x` is not repeated in the closing tag.
* End of paragraph, transcribed as `//` -- This will be converted to `</p><p>`. Be aware to properly nest elements (see https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_syntax.asp under "XML Elements Must be Properly Nested"). For example, in the sample .txt-file provided, the last `//` must follow the closing rubric tag `</r>`. Otherwise, the rubric would begin within a paragraph but not end there.
